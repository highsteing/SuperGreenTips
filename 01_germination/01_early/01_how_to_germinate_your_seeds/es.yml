    Now that your grow box is ready and that you have received your seed; *let’s get growing!*

    First step is germination, it’s time to wake up our chosen seed.
    Seeds are made to survive through winter and sprout when 3 conditions are met:

    * Water: activates the seed’s growth hormones while making the shell easier to break through.
    * Temperature: signals the plant it is safe to sprout, winter is over.
    * Oxygen: determines how deep the seed is, low oxygen would mean it’s too deep and won’t be able to reach the surface.

    1. Put the seed in a glass filled with slightly warm water.
    2. Put the glass in a dark place for 24 hours.
