    **Slowly** pour your PH adjusted solution evenly on the surface of the pot until you see run off through the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot.
    Water should pool up on the surface of the soil while youâ€™re watering and get absorbed slowly.
    *If the soil is dry, water will be quickly end in run off. Wait a couple minutes for the soil to absord some water and try again until the water is slowly absorbed.*
