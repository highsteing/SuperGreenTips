    The cotyledons are the first set of round leaves your seedling will develop while germinating.
    Once the first set of true leaves (the famous pointy ones) are established; your plant moves up to the vegetative state.
    It is the main growth phase where the plant develops leaves and branches that will support bud once it goes into flowering.
