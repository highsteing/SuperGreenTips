    Now that you have your seed, the first step is **germination**:
    1. Put the seed in a glass filled with room temperature water.
    2. Put the glass in a dark place for 24 hours.

      Fill out a small glass with room temperature.
      Remove seed from packaging *be gentle, don't crush the seed while trying to get it out*
      Drop it in the water, some seeds will float and others sink instantly.

      Cover the top of the glass or place it in a dark place for 24h.
      This leaves enough time for the seed to absord enough water to start the germination process and soften the shell.

      Seeds are made to survive through winter and sprout when 3 conditions are met:

      * Water: activates the seed's growth hormones while making the shell easier to break through.
      * Temperature: signals the plant it is safe to sprout, winter is over.
      * Oxygen: determines how deep the seed is, low oxygen would mean it's too deep and won't be able to reach the surface.
