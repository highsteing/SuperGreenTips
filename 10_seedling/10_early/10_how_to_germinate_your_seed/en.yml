      Seeds are made to survive through winter and sprout when 3 conditions are met:

      * Water: activates the seed’s growth hormones while making the shell easier to break through.
      * Temperature: signals the plant it is safe to sprout, winter is over.
      * Oxygen: determines how deep the seed is, low oxygen would mean it’s too deep and won’t be able to reach the surface.
