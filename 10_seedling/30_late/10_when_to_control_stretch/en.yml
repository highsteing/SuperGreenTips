    Keep track of growth by measuring how your plant stretches along the cycles.
    In seedling stage measure the stem, the way it grows determines the light level
    In vegetative stage measure the internodal space (the distance between 2 sets of branches)
    In flowering stage your plant will stretch to make room for buds
