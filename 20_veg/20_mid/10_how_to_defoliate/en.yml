    Defoliation is the act of removing leaves to redirect energy to interesting growth spots and allow for better light penetration.
    Start from the top of the plant, lift the bigger leaves, is it covering up and casting shadow over a new growth spot?
    If yes then pinch the leaf's stem with your nails and cut it off.
    Repeat the process from top to bottom.
