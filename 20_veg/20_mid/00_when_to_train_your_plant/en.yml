    Increase yield potential by training your plant to best fit it's space and light configuration.
    In tight spaces with vertical lighting it's simple, training starts with a healthy plant having between 3-5 nodes.
    *important note: only train a healthy plant - training an sick/weak plant may harm the plant*
