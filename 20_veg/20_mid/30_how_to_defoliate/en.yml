    Defoliation is a pruning method which consists in strategically removing leaves to redirect the plant's energy to boost both growth and yield.
    1. Start from the top; check under big leaves, if it's covering up a future branch/bud site; remove it by pinching the stem with your fingernails.
    2. Move your way down and keep removing the bigger leaves that cast shadows over interesting growth spots.
    3. Tangled/overlaping leaves should aslo be removed to help out your plant's succesful development.
