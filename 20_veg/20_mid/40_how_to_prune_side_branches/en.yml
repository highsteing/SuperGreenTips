    Pruning is any form of removing plant material to have a plant grow a certain way.
    Our goal is to end up with a 'flat' 1 axis plant (like a menorah) to make better use of our available space and vertical side lighting configuration.
    1. Check your plants growth by nodes; #1 and #2 are usually quite weak, #3 and #4 are the ones you're interested in.
    2. Select the axis showing the best growth, node thickness
    3. Cut all side branches that are perpendicular to your selected axis.
