    **Trimming brings out more smell than the flowering stage - be smart, stay safe**
    Trimming checklist:
      - trim bin to work in (get one with a mesh for simple trichome collection)
      - gloves; cannabis resin is extremly sticky 
      - pruning shears to cut branches
      - trimming scisors to cut away the leaves left on the bud
    1. Cut down branches one at a time, it's easier to work with
    2. Remove all fan leaves (all the leaves that are not covered in trichomes) *you can dispose of them* 
    3. Cut away the sugar leaves sticking out of your bud as closely as you can to end up with a smooth shaped bud.
    *note: save them as they are covered in trichomes and can be used to make concentrates and edibles*
    4. If your humidity is very high (RH>60%) you'll want to cut the bigger buds into smaller ones to allow for better drying.
