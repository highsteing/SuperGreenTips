    You want your buds to dry slowly enough to avoid "hay smell" while avoiding moisture build-up to prevent molding.
    Place your buds evenly in a drying rack or hang them upside down in a dark and well ventilated place.
    Check on them daily until the small stems snap and the bigger ones bend (3-7days)
    Buds should feel dry to the touch.
