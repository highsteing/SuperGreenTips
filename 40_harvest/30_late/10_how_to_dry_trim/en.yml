    Now that your harvest has dried it's time to trim!
    **Trimming brings out more smell than the flowering stage - be smart, stay safe**
    Trimming checklist:
      - trim bin to work in (get one with a mesh for simple trichome collection)
      - gloves; cannabis resin is extremly sticky 
      - pruning shears to cut branches
      - trimming scisors to cut away the leaves left on the bud   
    1. Work with 1 branch at a time
    2. Remove all fan leaves (all the leaves that are not covered in trichomes) *you can dispose of them* 
    3. Cut away the sugar leaves sticking out of your bud as closely as you can to end up with a smooth shaped bud.
    *note: save them as they are covered in trichomes and can be used to make concentrates and edibles*
