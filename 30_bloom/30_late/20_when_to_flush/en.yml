    Flushing: only using pH water for the last 1-2weeks before harvesting to improve the quality and smoothness of your cannabis buds.
    When you see the the trichomes get close to your prefered ratio it's time to flush.
    Water as usual just don't add any nutrients :)
    *note: don't forget to check and adjust your pH*
